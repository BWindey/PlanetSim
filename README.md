# PlanetSim
This is a fun little project I made after being inspired by a friend. I decided
this was a good moment to try the interesting [C3 language](https://c3-lang.org/).
Paired with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), this turned out to be quite the
breeze actually!


## Try it yourself
Download the C3 compiler from
https://c3-lang.org/getting-started/prebuilt-binaries/ or
install it from source through the official instructions:
https://c3-lang.org/getting-started/compile/
.

Clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BWindey/PlanetSim.git
```

And `c3c run` inside the project. If everything goes well, you should see
something like this:
